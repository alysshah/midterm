          <p class="bio">I'm a French-Indian college student, born and raised in Maryland, in the US. I grew up in the French school system and am currently in my first year at NYU, pursuing a BS degree in Integrated Digital Media.</p>
          <p class="bio">I'm passionate about the intersection of art and technology, mainly taking interest in topics such as digital art, programming, and game development. I've experimented with graphic design using the Adobe Creative Suite, explored game dev using Unity, and spent years making art using numerous mediums (digital, pencil/pen, charcoal, pastel, oil, pyrography, etc.).</p>
          <p class="bio">In my free time, I also enjoy playing competitive soccer, reading, listening to music, and hanging out with my dog :) </p>
